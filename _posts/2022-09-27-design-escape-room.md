This year, for the extended family Christmas party, we decided to play games instead of exchange presents. I had the idea of creating a Christmas themed escape room that we could all solve together. 

I recently came across the idea of "escape room in a box". This is a set of puzzles where everything you need to solve them (except common things like pen/scissors/etc.) is included in the box. Because the party is at my cousin's house, this is exactly the kind of thing I want, since it's easy to transport and doesn't require going through her stuff to set up or solve. But none of my purchased escape room in a box kits are Christmas themed and also aren't meant to be played by 20ish people (if everyone participates) at once. So, I did some research on how to design an escape room myself.

Google provides entirely too many ideas for escape room puzzles. These two articles were helpful in making sense of the design process and what a finished game might look like.

- [Free Printable Escape Room for Kids](https://teachingideas.ca/2022/04/18/free-printable-escape-room/)

From my research, I developed the following parameters for the finished game:

- The game should consist of 5 - 6 puzzles
- The puzzles should be elementary school difficulty level so the kids can participate (and because the adults have never played an escape room)
- I do not want to buy a bunch of locks or type into a phone to verify the correct answer. Whether the answer is correct or not needs to be obvious from the puzzle itself. 
- Similar to the above, the materials to create the puzzles need to be easily available, either in my existing crafting supplies or printed from the computer.
 
### Escape Room Theme

Since it is for a Christmas party, I made a list of some of my favorite Christmas movies as a kid. (Also, nothing overtly religious, so that it would be acceptable at work, if there is an opportunity to use it there.)

- [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_(TV_special))
- [The Nutcracker Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutcracker_Prince)
- [Frosty the Snowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosty_the_Snowman_(TV_special))
- [A Charlie Brown Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas)
- [How the Grinch Stole Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas!_(TV_special))

In the plot of Rudolph, the title character runs away with Hermey the elf, escapes the Abominable Snow Monster, arrives at and leaves the Island of Misfit Toys, rescues his family, and becomes Santa's lead reindeer. There is a lot of travelling and not much else to build puzzles from.

While The Nutcracker Prince does have a few spots for good puzzles, such as fixing the nutcracker and trapping the Mouse King in a drawer, the ending is more like &quot;it was all a dream&quot; than a satisfying puzzle solution. So, not this one either. 

In Frosty the Snowman, there is building the snowman, sneaking on the train, finding the greenhouse and getting help from Santa. There are enough different kinds of actions to work with for a variety of puzzles. I stopped reviewing the list of movies with Frosty and went on to designing the puzzles.

### Design Puzzles

#### Puzzle 1 - Build a Snowman

The goal is to build the snowman and put the magic hat on his head so that he comes to life. My initial plan was to provide styrofoam balls to build the snowman. I tried to think of something to be &quot;the answer&quot; or a clue to the next puzzle that would be on the snowman, if he was put together properly. A sequence of numbers, maybe? But, that run into the condition that I don't use a program to verify the answer. 

So, I changed the puzzle so that building the snowman is just for atmosphere, and the real puzzle is selecting the magic hat from a pile of hats. There would be clues, like in a logic puzzle, to determine which hat to select and an indicator in or on the hat to verify if it's the correct one.

The last change to this puzzle was from finding a printable with snowman parts. Instead of figuring out how to stick styrofoam balls together and building 3D hats, I decided to use the printable for the players to build the snowman in 2D flat on the table. The hats are also 2D, with an indicator on the back to verify which one is correct. This is much easier to transport and to create more copies of.

#### Puzzle 2 - Go to the Train Station

I've seen other puzzles where the characters of the answer are found along the correct path of a maze. This was one of the easiest puzzle to create. I made a small maze with Frosty at one end and a train at the other. The answer is the snowman's name, and it's pretty obvious if it's correct or not.

#### Puzzle 3 - Build a Fire

When the girl travelling with Frosty gets too cold, the woodland animals build her a fire. For this one, I took a picture and cut it into strips. Once the fire picture is assembled, it can be turned over to reveal where they go next. 

#### Puzzle 4 - Contact Santa

In the movie, the rabbit goes off on a side quest to wait for Santa. This doesn't work for the flow of the escape room. So, instead, the player contacts Santa by calling him on the telephone. Similarly to the hats, the different phone numbers have a symbol on the back for whose number it is. Isn't it convenient that &quot;Santa Claus&quot; has 10 letters? I used other holiday personas for the rest of the phone numbers. This is probably the hardest puzzle in this set.

#### Puzzle 5 - Unlock the Greenhouse

This was the hardest puzzle to develop. I needed some kind of lock, but one that was easy to make and to determine whether the correct answer was input or not. Eventually, I settled on using strips of paper with numbers on one side and symbols on the other side. If the correct numbers are selected, the symbols on the other side will all match to indicate that the lock is now open. All other symbols only appear on 3 of the 4 strips, so no other combination can be correct. 

### Put it all Together

For the text of the escape room, I borrowed heavily from the script for Frosty the Snowman. Then, I had the idea of adding in some interactive questions to engage the littlest cousins, like &quot;What fun things do you do when it snows?&quot; That means this ended up as a series of guided puzzles rather than an escape room. 

For the party, I printed off one copy of the narrator/instructions document and 3 copies of each of the puzzles. Then, to account for the large number of people, I can have 3 different groups spread around the room working on the same puzzle. And, I put post-it notes over the back of the items that get flipped over to see if they're correct, just in case. Each puzzle was placed in a labeled envelope, so I can give a packet of envelopes to each group and tell them when to open each one. 

Now, I just need to come up with prizes...
