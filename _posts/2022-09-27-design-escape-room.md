This year, for the extended family Christmas party, we decided to play games instead of exchange 
presents. I had the idea of creating a Christmas themed escape room that we could all solve 
together. 

I recently came across the idea of "escape room in a box". This is a set of puzzles where everything 
you need to solve them (except common things like pen/scissors/etc.) is included in the box. Because 
the party is at my cousin's house, this is exactly the kind of thing I want, since it's easy to 
transport and doesn't require going through her stuff to set up or solve. But none of my purchased 
escape room in a box kits are Christmas themed and also aren't meant to be played by 20ish people 
(if everyone participates) at once. So, I did some research on how to design an escape room myself.

Google provides entirely too many ideas for escape room puzzles. These two articles were helpful
in making sense of the design process and what a finished game might look like.

- [Free Printable Escape Room for Kids](https://teachingideas.ca/2022/04/18/free-printable-escape-room/)

From my research, I developed the following parameters for the finished game:

- The game should consist of 5 - 6 puzzles
- The puzzles should be elementary school difficulty level so the kids can participate (and because
 the adults have never played an escape room)
- I do not want to buy a bunch of locks or type into a phone to verify the correct answer. Whether the 
 answer is correct or not needs to be obvious from the puzzle itself. 
- Similar to the above, the materials to create the puzzles need to be easily available, either in 
 my existing crafting supplies or printed from the computer.
 
### Escape Room Theme

Since it is for a Christmas party, I made a list of some of my favorite Christmas movies as a kid. 
(Also, nothing overtly religious, so that it would be acceptable at work, if there is an opportunity 
to use it there.)

- [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_(TV_special))
- [The Nutcracker Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutcracker_Prince)
- [Frosty the Snowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosty_the_Snowman_(TV_special))
- [A Charlie Brown Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas)
- [How the Grinch Stole Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas!_(TV_special))

In the plot of Rudolph, the title character runs away with Hermey the elf, escapes the Abominable 
Snow Monster, arrives at and leaves the Island of Misfit Toys, rescues his family, and becomes 
Santa's lead reindeer. There is a lot of travelling and not much else to build puzzles from.

While The Nutcracker Prince does have a few spots for good puzzles, such as fixing the nutcracker 
and trapping the Mouse King in a drawer, the ending is more like &quot;it was all a dream&quot; than 
a satisfying puzzle solution. So, not this one either. 

In Frosty the Snowman, there is building the snowman, sneaking on the train, finding the greenhouse 
and getting help from Santa. This is enough different kind of actions to work with for a variety of 
puzzles. I stopped reviewing the list of movies with Frosty and went on to designing the puzzles.

### Design Puzzles

#### Puzzle 1 - Build a Snowman

The goal is to build the snowman and put the magic hat on his head so that he comes to life. My 
initial plan was to provide styrofoam balls to build the snowman. I tried to think of something to 
be &quot;the answer&quot; or a clue to the next puzzle that would be on the snowman, if he was put 
together properly. A sequence of numbers, maybe? But, that run into the condition that I don't use 
a program to verify the answer. 

So, I changed the puzzle so that building the snowman is just for atmosphere, and the real puzzle is 
selecting the magic hat from a pile of hats. There would be clues, like in a logic puzzle, to 
determine which hat to select and an indicator in or on the hat to verify if it's the correct one.

The last change to this puzzle was from finding a printable with snowman parts. Instead of figuring 
out how to stick styrofoam balls together and building 3D hats, I decided to use the printable for 
the players to build the snowman in 2D flat on the table. The hats are also 2D, with an indicator on 
the back to verify which one is correct. 

#### Puzzle 2 - Go to the Train Station
