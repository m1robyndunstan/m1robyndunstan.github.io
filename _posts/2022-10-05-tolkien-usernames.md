I'm writing unit tests for a C# API. I used to use a website that generated "real sounding" names and characteristics for my test users, but one of the random names was the same as the name of a real person my manager knew, and I was told to use names that are more obviously fake. So, I made a list of names from Tolkien's Middle-earth. Part of the test data for these unit tests is coming up with a username. I have a few I consider amusing, and I thought I'd share. 

| Name | Username |
| --- | --- |
| [Lobelia Sackville-Baggins](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lobelia_Sackville-Baggins) | betterbaggins@test |
| [Curufinwe Feanaro](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/F%C3%ABanor) | bestfinwe@test |
| [Telufinwe Ambarussa](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Amras) | lastone@test |
