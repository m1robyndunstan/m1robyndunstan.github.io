I also have degrees in Mathematics and Physics. While I don't use this knowledge in my everyday job, it still greatly influences the way I think.

My bookshelves are overflowing with science fiction and fantasy novels. Any space not filled with books is covered in cat toys. My fur babies are my pride and joy.
