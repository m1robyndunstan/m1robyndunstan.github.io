I'm a computer programmer with 5+ years experience, mostly in back-end programming. I've worked in a variety of languages, with the most recent ones listed above. I'm always interested in learning new computer languages and programming technigues.

My bookshelves are overflowing with science fiction and fantasy novels. Any space not filled with books is covered in cat toys. My fur babies are my pride and joy.
