# Software Developer

I have about 10 years of experience with a variety of computer languages and technologies. The ones I've worked with most recently are listed below. I'm always interested in learning new computer languages and programming technigues.

 - JavaScript
 - Angular
 - C#
 - Java
 - PowerOn

See some of my projects in [my other repositories](https://github.com/m1robyndunstan?tab=repositories)

![Science](/assets/img/science.png){: .is-pulled-right .ml-6 style="max-width: 33%;"}
I also have degrees in Mathematics and Physics. While I don't use this knowledge in my everyday job, it still has a great influence on me. To me, being a scientist isn't about how many facts one can memorize, but instead it's a way of thinking. 

I enjoy science fiction and fantasy stories, especially with good worldbuilding. Some of my favorites, in no particular order:

 - [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars)
 - [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)
 - [Anne McCaffery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_McCaffrey)
 - [Terry Brooks](https://terrybrooks.net/)
 - [Mercedes Lackey](http://www.mercedeslackey.com/)
 - [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/)
 - [Sailor Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon)
 - [Yu-Gi-Oh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!)

There may be the occasional bit of my own worldbuilding or fanfiction appearing here, too.

I also enjoy doing crafts. Mostly, I crochet, though I occasionally dabble in other activities. 

And, then, there are my cats. They are my precious fur babies, and I love telling everyone stories about them.
