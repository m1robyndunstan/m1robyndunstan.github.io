I also have degrees in Mathematics and Physics. While I don't use this knowledge in my everyday job, it still has a great influence on me. To me, being a scientist isn't about how many facts one can memorize, but instead it's a way of thinking.

My bookshelves are overflowing with science fiction and fantasy novels. Any space not filled with books is covered in cat toys. My fur babies are my pride and joy.
